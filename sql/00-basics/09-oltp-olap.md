# OLTP VS OLAP

## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

- OLTP systems are designed to manage and facilitate transaction-oriented applications.
- They are optimized for a large number of short online transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- OLTP databases are highly normalized to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
- They support real-time data processing and are used in applications like banking, order processing, and customer relationship management (CRM).

## OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

- OLAP systems are designed for complex queries and data analysis.
- They are optimized for read-heavy operations and can handle large volumes of data.
- OLAP databases are often denormalized to improve query performance and simplify data retrieval.
- They support multidimensional analysis and are used in applications like business intelligence, data mining, reporting, and analysis.
