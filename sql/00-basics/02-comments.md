# Comments in SQL

## Single-line Comments

- Single-line comments start with `--` and continue to the end of the line.

- Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees; 
-- This is a single-line comment
```

## Multi-line Comments

- Multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.

- Example:

```sql

multi-line comment.
*/
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
