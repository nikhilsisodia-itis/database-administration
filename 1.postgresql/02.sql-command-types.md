# Types of SQL Commands

SQL commands are instructions used to communicate with a database. They are grouped into different types based on what they do.

## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

These commands define or change the structure of database objects like tables.

- **CREATE**: Makes a new table.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name TEXT);
  ```

- **ALTER**: Changes an existing table.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN age INT;
  ```

- **DROP**: Deletes a table.

  ```sql
  DROP TABLE students;
  ```

## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

These commands are used to manage data inside tables.

- **INSERT**: Adds new data.

  ```sql

  INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');
  ```

- **UPDATE**: Changes existing data.
  
  ```sql
  UPDATE students SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **DELETE**: Removes data.
  
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;
  ```

## 3. Data Query Language (DQL)

Used to fetch data from the database.

- **SELECT**: Gets data from tables.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM students;
  ```

## 4. Data Control Language (DCL)

Controls access to data in the database.

- **GRANT**: Gives user access rights.

  ```sql

  GRANT SELECT ON students TO user1;

  ```

- **REVOKE**: Removes access rights.

  ```sql
  REVOKE SELECT ON students FROM user1;
  ```
