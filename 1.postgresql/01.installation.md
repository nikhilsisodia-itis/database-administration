# Installation

## Verifying Installation

After installing PostgreSQL, verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
psql --version
```

If you see the version number, PostgreSQL is installed correctly.

## For Windows

### Step 1

- Download the PostgreSQL installer from the official website: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

### Step 2

- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Step 3

- During the installation, you will be prompted to set a password for the PostgreSQL superuser (default user is `postgres`).

### Step 4

- After installation, you can use pgAdmin (a graphical interface) or psql (command-line tool) to manage your PostgreSQL databases.

### Step 5

- To start the PostgreSQL service, go to `Services` in Windows and look for `postgresql-x64-XX` (where XX is the version number), then start the service if it is not already running.

### Step 6

- You can connect to your PostgreSQL server using the following command in the command prompt:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

**Note:** If you installed PostgreSQL using the official installer, the service may be managed differently. Refer to the installer documentation for service management commands.

### Step 8: Uninstalling/Upgrading

**Uninstalling/Upgrading:**
To uninstall or upgrade PostgreSQL installed via Homebrew:

```bash
brew uninstall postgresql
brew upgrade postgresql
```

## For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

### Step 1: Update Package List

- Update your package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 2: Install PostgreSQL

- Install PostgreSQL:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### Step 3: Post-Installation Steps

- After installation, the PostgreSQL service should start automatically. You can check its status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

### Step 4: Switch to Postgres User

- Switch to the `postgres` user:

```bash
sudo -i -u postgres
```

### Step 5: Access PostgreSQL Prompt

- Access the PostgreSQL prompt:

```bash
psql
```

### Step 6: Exit PostgreSQL Prompt

- Exit the PostgreSQL prompt:

```sql
\q
```

### Additional Steps

- (Optional) Set a password for the `postgres` user:

```sql
\password postgres
```

- (Optional) Create a new database user and database:

```sql
CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
CREATE DATABASE mydb OWNER myuser;
```

### Step 7: Connect to PostgreSQL

- You can connect to your PostgreSQL server using the following command:

```bash
psql -U myuser -d mydb
```

  Enter the password you set for `myuser` when prompted.

- Troubleshooting:
      - If the service does not start, run: `sudo systemctl start postgresql`
      - If you get authentication errors, check `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf` for authentication method (peer vs. md5).
      - For remote connections, ensure port 5432 is open and listen_addresses is set in `postgresql.conf`.
