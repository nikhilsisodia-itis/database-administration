# File System VS Database

## File System

- A file system is a way of organizing and storing files on a computer or storage device.
- Files are stored in a hierarchical structure of directories and subdirectories.
- File systems are designed for storing and retrieving files, not for managing relationships between data.
- Examples of file systems include NTFS (Windows), HFS+ (Mac), and ext4 (Linux).

## Database

- A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed by a database management system (DBMS).
- Databases are designed for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and management.
- They support complex queries and relationships between data entities.
- Examples of database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Key Differences

- **Structure**: File systems store files in a hierarchical structure, while databases store data in tables with rows and columns.
- **Data Relationships**: Databases are designed to manage relationships between data entities, while file systems do not have built-in support for relationships.
- **Querying**: Databases support complex queries using SQL, while file systems typically use simpler methods for file retrieval.
- **Data Integrity**: Databases enforce data integrity and consistency through constraints and transactions, while file systems do not provide the same level of data integrity.
