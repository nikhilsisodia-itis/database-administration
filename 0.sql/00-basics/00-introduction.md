# Introduction

## What is Data?

- Data is a collection of facts, figures, and statistics that can be processed and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.
- It helps in decision-making, identifying trends, and improving processes within an organization.

## What is Information?

- Information is data that has been processed, organized, or structured in a way that makes it meaningful and useful for decision-making.
- It provides context and relevance to data, allowing individuals and organizations to gain insights and make informed choices.

## What is a Database?

- A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, stored electronically in a computer system, cloud-based environment, or on-premises database infrastructure(collection of hardware and software).
- Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), which allow users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently.
- They enable the storage of large amounts of data while providing mechanisms for data integrity, security, and concurrent access.

## Significance of the Database symbol- üõ¢Ô∏è

- The origin of the database symbol is back in the early days of computing when data was stored in physical barrels or containers called Drum Memory.
- The symbol has since evolved to represent modern databases, which store data in a more abstract and efficient manner.

## What is SQL?

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.
- It provides a way to interact with the database by allowing users to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- SQL is widely used in various database management systems (DBMS) and is essential for database administrators, developers, and data analysts.

## What is a Database Management System?

- A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables the creation, management, and manipulation of databases.
- It provides a systematic way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency.
- DBMS can be classified into different types, such as relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL, each with its own data model and use cases.

## What is a Relational Database?

- A Relational Database is a type of database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.
- It is based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables (relations) that can be linked‚Äîor related‚Äîbased on data common to each.
- Relational databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and maintaining the database.

## What is a Relational Database Management System?

- A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of DBMS that is based on the relational model.
- It allows users to create, manage, and manipulate relational databases using SQL.
- RDBMS enforces data integrity and consistency through the use of constraints, relationships, and transactions.
- Popular RDBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.
