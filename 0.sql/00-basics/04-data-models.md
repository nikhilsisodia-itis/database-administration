# Introduction to Data Models

## What are Data Models?

- Data Models are abstract (displaying only the essential or required information, and hiding the irrelevant details) representations of the data structures and relationships within a database.
- They define how data is organized, stored, and accessed, providing a blueprint for database design.
- Data models help ensure data consistency, integrity, and efficiency in database operations.
- There are several types of data models, including conceptual, logical, and physical models.

## Most widely used Data Models

1. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**: Represents data entities and their relationships. Commonly used in database design.
2. **Relational Model**: Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. SQL is based on this model.
3. **Object-Oriented Model**: Represents data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Supports complex data types and relationships.
4. **Document Model**: Used in NoSQL databases, stores data in document formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Suitable for unstructured data.
5. **Key-Value Model**: Stores data as key-value pairs. Simple and efficient for specific use cases, often used in caching and session management.
